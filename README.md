# Mirage-Security
> Simulates a hostile environment for malware 

Mirage-Security simulates the use of virtualization and reverse engineering tools to prevent the execution of paranoid malware. Artifacts are placed in the filesystem & registry to give the appearance of execution within a virtual machine, and several fake processes are spawned with the names of commonly used debugging tools. Global mutexes are also created to mimic previous infection markers.
